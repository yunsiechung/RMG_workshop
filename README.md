**Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG)** is a Python-based open-source software for automatically generating chemical reaction
mechanisms for modeling reaction systems including pyrolysis, combustion, atmospheric science, and more.

This repository contains materials and slides prepared for the RMG & RMG-Cat Workshop at 2022 Fall ACS Meeting.
The workshop slides will be uploaded on the day of the workshop on Thursday, August 25th 2022.

**Please make sure that you install RMG and download the materials BEFORE attending the workshop.**

## How to Install
RMG is currently supported only on Linux OS. If you do not have a Linux computer, please install Ubuntu
either using Virtual Machine or Linux Subsystem. To set up a Linux Virtual Machine from Windows, see this [page](http://reactionmechanismgenerator.github.io/RMG-Py/users/rmg/installation/virtualMachineSetup.html)
for detailed instruction. To set up the Linux Subsystem on Windows 10, see this [page](http://reactionmechanismgenerator.github.io/RMG-Py/users/rmg/installation/linuxSubsystem.html)
for instruction.

Once you have Linux (Ubuntu) set up, follow the instruction on the [Download and Install](http://reactionmechanismgenerator.github.io/RMG-Py/users/rmg/installation/anacondaUser.html) 
to install RMG binary using Anaconda. Try running the RMG test job by following Step 4 of the installation guide to make sure
RMG is installed properly.
